DESCRIPTION
    WWW::NationalRail is a Perl interface to the UK national rail timetable
    at http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/planmyjourney/

    new()
        The constructor accepts the arguments for the search as a has
        reference. The from and to fields are required, the rest are
        optional and will use a National Rail supplied default.

        via        Via station.

        out_date   Outbound date in the format "DD/MM/YY". Defaults to
                   today.

        out_type   Possible values are "depart" to search by outbound
                   departure time or "arrive" to search by outbound arrival
                   time. Defaults to "depart".

        out_hour   Outbound hour, 0 to 23. Defaults to sometime in the near
                   future.

        out_minute Outbound minute, 0 to 59. Defaults to sometime in the
